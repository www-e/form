### Report and Recommendations

Here is a detailed report based on my analysis of your project.

#### 1. Potential Issues & Risks

Your application is well-structured, but there are a few areas that could be improved for robustness and security.

*   **Critical Security Risk (Data Exposure):**
    *   **Issue:** The Row Level Security (RLS) policy `Allow public read-only access` on the `registrations_2025_2026` table allows **anyone** with your Supabase URL and Anon Key to download the personal information (name, phone numbers) of all registered students. This is a significant privacy violation.
    *   **Recommendation:** Change the RLS policy to `Enable read access for authenticated users only`. Create a secure admin user account using Supabase Auth and perform all data-fetching on the admin pages as that authenticated user.

*   **Critical Security Risk (Unauthorized Admin Access):**
    *   **Issue:** The RLS policy `Allow anonymous full access to manage schedules` on the `schedules` table means **anyone on the internet can add, edit, or delete your class schedules**, which could disrupt your entire registration system.
    *   **Recommendation:** The admin pages (`admin.html`, `schedule-admin.html`) should be protected by a login system (Supabase Auth). The RLS policies on `schedules` should be updated to only allow `ALL` actions for an authenticated user with an "admin" role.

*   **Data Integrity:**
    *   **Issue:** When a schedule is deleted from the admin panel, the student registrations in `registrations_2025_2026` that point to it become "orphaned," as there is no database-level link (foreign key) between the tables.
    *   **Recommendation:** Consider adding a foreign key constraint from `registrations_2025_2026` to `schedules`. Alternatively, when deleting a schedule, check if any students are registered for it and either warn the admin or prevent the deletion. Using "soft deletes" (an `is_deleted` flag) is another great option.

*   **Performance at Scale:**
    *   **Issue:** Both the student admin page (`admin.js`) and the schedule admin page (`main-admin.js`) fetch all records from the database on page load and then perform filtering on the client-side. This will become slow and unresponsive as the number of students and schedules grows.
    *   **Recommendation:** Implement server-side pagination and filtering. Instead of fetching everything, pass filter parameters to Supabase (e.g., using `.limit()`, `.range()`, `.ilike()` for search) to only retrieve the data needed for the current view.

#### 2. Extra Features & Small Improvements

Here are some suggestions to enhance the user experience and functionality of your admin panel.

*   **Admin Dashboard Enhancements:**
    *   **Capacity Management:** Add a `capacity` column to your `schedules` table. In the registration form, check the number of registered students for a group against its capacity and display real-time availability like "3 spots left" or "Full".
    *   **Visual Analytics:** On `admin.html`, add charts (e.g., using Chart.js) to visualize data like "Registrations per Day" or "Student Distribution by Grade."

*   **Form & UI Improvements:**
    *   **Loading Indicators on Buttons:** When a user clicks "Save" or "Delete", the button should enter a loading state (e.g., show a spinner) and be disabled to prevent multiple clicks while the request is processing. You've done this well on the main registration form; apply it consistently in the admin panel.
    *   **Better Search:** The student search on `admin.html` is good. You could add a similar search bar on the `schedule-admin.html` page to quickly find groups by name.
    *   **Unified Configuration:** Consolidate configuration values like `GRADE_NAMES` and `SECTION_NAMES` into a single, shared file (like your `js/config.js`) and import it wherever needed to avoid duplication and potential inconsistencies between the registration form and the admin panel.

*   **Code Quality & Maintenance:**
    *   **Typo Fix:** In `js/pages/schedule-admin/table-handler.js` on line 61, the code `e.target.closest('.edit-btn')` has a typo. The buttons have the class `.edit`. It should be `e.target.closest('.edit')`.
    *   **Environment Variables:** For better security practice, store your Supabase URL and Anon Key in environment variables rather than hardcoding them directly in your JavaScript files, especially for a production application.
